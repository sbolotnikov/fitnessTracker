## Description 
Fitness Tracker utilizes MongoDB to track a user's daily exercises. Weekly workout statistics are reflected on Dashboard charts.

### User Story
User wants to be able to view create and track daily workouts and to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
